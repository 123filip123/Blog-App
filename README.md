Create a user trough admin interface.
Admin credentials (admin : admin).
When you create a user, create a profile after and assign the user you just created to it.
Now you have an account!

Edit your post, edit your comments.
Edit your profile.
View other users profiles.
Block other users from viewing your posts.
Search by title and description. Filter by date (from-to).
